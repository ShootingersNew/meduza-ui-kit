# shared styles or style variables

The `variables.js` file defines various design-related constants such as text sizes and color palettes. These constants are then used to generate a Stylus file with the corresponding variables and classes, which can be used throughout the project for consistent styling.

### Fonts

Initialize your fonts in 'fonts.styl'

### Stylus Content

The constants are used to generate a Stylus file via npm <sub>npm build</sub> or <sub>npm generate-stylus</sub>

After you changed something there just run <sub>npm generate-stylus</sub>
